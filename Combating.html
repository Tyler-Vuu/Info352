        <h1>How we are combating the AI ethics issue</h1>
        <p>While the way we currently train AI can lead to a design with flaws,
            it is not an unsolvable problem and there are a few solutions that can lead to
            more ethical AI design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step in creating more ethical AI is education. So much of
            the people creating AI is focused on the moving forward of the technology
            and it's these people that are often uneducated in the potential ethical
            issues of pushing forward as fast as possible. Programs created should
            “focus on ethical implications, potential risks, and the guidelines for data
            usage.”(Reineke) It’s crucial to build these fundamentals so that employees can
            navigate the complex nature of generative AI and know the potential ethical implications
            associated with their different decisions when creating ethical AI. The people creating it
            should not be the only ones to be educated on the benefits of AI as educating the public
            can also cover for the inevitable flaws of biased and misinformation of AI. In the mind of
            the general public, AI is a magic box that spits out answers and most will take the answers at face
            value leading to the spread of bias and misinformation. Giving transparency in the process of AI and
            educating the public on the shortcomings of the technology will lead to a more healthy relationship with AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second solution involves fixing the workplace culture and diversity of AI companies.
            So much of the current AI workforce is made up of white males that voices of representation
            within these companies are often overlooked and concerns of AI bias are thrown aside in favor
            of progress. According to Joy Buolamwini, “Less than 2% of employees in technical roles at Facebook
            and Google are black and at eight large tech companies only around a fifth of the technical workforce
            at each are women.” (Buolamwini)It’s important for the people affected the most by the flaws in AI to
            be in the room while it’s being developed. The more diverse the workforce, the more that ethical design
            will find its way into AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, a good place to look at how to make AI more ethical is to fix the way that we train our AI.
            To create the large language models behind AI, enormous amounts of data are needed to train it and
            it’s through this process that the AI can come to racist or sexist conclusions through the data it
            receives. “Ensuring that the training data is fair, unbiased, and representative of diverse inputs
            is a critical part of maintaining ethical integrity in generative AI.”(Reineke). When one samples data
            from convenience and does not take into consideration the importance of unbiased training data, you
            get a biased AI that reinforces the stereotypes and suppression of minorities. Another problem with
            training AI has to do with the development of AI in first-world countries. Most large datasets suitable
            for machine learning training come from first-world countries and as a result, “AI-generated language
            will be homogenized, reflecting the practices of the richest countries and communities.”(Raikes) We
            must ensure that the future of AI is for everyone and not just a way for the richest countries to spread
            their influence further. While it may be difficult for these countries to build up the wealth of databases
            needed to train AIs, I think it’s important to acknowledge this shortcoming and find ways to make up for
            this
            shortcoming.
