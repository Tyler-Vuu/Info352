            <p>In the rapidly evolving technology era, AI has become an integral part of our daily lives.
                From visually generative AI such as Midjourney to voice assistants like Siri and Alexa,
                AI has permeated various aspects of society. Moreover, AI now started to be used as crucial
                tools in public services, such as transportation and law enforcement. Despite the fact that
                AI has become increasingly important in peopleâ€™s lives, the way AI is trained can be inadequate
                and has been shown to reinforce stereotypes around race, gender, and other societal biases.</p>

                    <h2>Race and AI</h2>
                </a>
                <p>In this section, we aim to explore the complex and ongoing issue of AI and race.
                    We will include examples that support the argument and highlight the challenges in
                    our relationship with AI, particularly in how it mirrors, amplifies, and reinforces
                    societal biases. Our goal is to encourage you to critically reflect on the role of AI in society
                    and to offer a fresh perspective on the potential of AI to either perpetuate existing biases or
                    prompt meaningful social change.

                <p>In this section, we will delve into the issues that have become increasingly
                    prominent in our society today. With the introduction of examples from both the past
                    and today, we hope to call attention to the persistent challenges that women continue
                    to face. Our objective is to foster a deeper understanding of these challenges,
                    encouraging you to reflect on the progress made and the path forward in achieving gender equality.

                </a>
                <p>We know that the challenges surrounding these issues are not easily resolved.
                    However, we want to present some potential solutions that could contribute to
                    the evolution of AI. Our intention is to start constructing ideas on how technologies
                    can be harnessed to serve society better, and inspire readers to brainstorm the possible solutions.
